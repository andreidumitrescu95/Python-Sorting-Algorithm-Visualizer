# Python-Sorting-Algorithm-Visualizer (WIP)

I built this application in order to get much more accommodated with Python and Pygame and to have a much better understanding of the nature of various pathfinding algorithms through visualization.

## The Algorithms

**Bubble Sort** - is one of the simpler sorting algorithms as it repeatedly steps through the list comparing adjacent elements and swapping them in case they are not in ascending order. Worst case performance will be met when the array is entirely reversed so we would get O(n^2) comparisons and swaps. Best case would be if the array would be already sorted and it would amount to O(n) comparisons and O(1) swaps.

**Insertion Sort** - is also a pretty simple sorting algorithm that builds the sorted array one element at a time by removing the probed element and inserting it in the place it needs to be in the final sorted array. It performs well on small lists but it is not efficient on large lists and has much lower performance than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort or merge sort. Worst case performance is just like Bubble Sort, having O(n^2) comparisons and swaps when the array is completely reversed and also a best case performance of O(n) comparisons and O(1) swaps.

**Selection Sort** - also inefficient on large lists 

**Merge Sort**
